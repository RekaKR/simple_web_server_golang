# Simple Web Server in Golang
This learning project for building a simple web server implementation in Golang. It serves static content and handles basic HTTP requests.  
I used a freeCodeCamp.org video tutorial to learn and create this project.  

## Endpoints
GET /: Serves static files.  
POST /form: Handles form submissions.  
GET /hello: Greets the user with a "hello" message.
